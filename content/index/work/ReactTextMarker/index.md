Developed a React Text Marker component to dynamically highlight/mark words within a body of text.

It's a straightforward implementation that utilises JavaScript regular expressions to identify strings at points that match specific characters or patterns. There are better implementations, but this was perfect for my use case of highlighting keywords on a landing page.

This was also released on NPM! Feel free to [test it out](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devkosta/react-text-marker). I learned a lot about the NPM publishing process and plan on releasing other nifty tools soon.
